## Usage

To use this code, you need to include the necessary libraries, such as `Trade.mqh`. You can define the trading schedule parameters, risk management parameters, adaptable Level parameter, trade entry parameters, and trade exit parameters according to your trading strategy.

The `OnTick()` function is the main trading function that is executed on every tick. It checks if it's within the trading schedule, if the spread is acceptable, and if there is an available slot for trading. It then adjusts the Level parameter, executes the trade entry logic, and finally executes the trade exit logic.
